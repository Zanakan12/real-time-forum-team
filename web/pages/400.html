<h1>400</h1>
<p style="width: 30%; text-align: justify;">
    The HTTP 400 Bad Request client error response status code indicates that the server would not process the request due to something the server considered to be a client error. The reason for a 400 response is typically due to malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing. Clients that receive a 400 response should expect that repeating the request without modification will fail with the same error.

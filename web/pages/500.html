<h1>500</h1>
<p style="width: 30%; text-align: justify;">
    The HTTP 500 Internal Server Error server error response status code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This error is a generic "catch-all" response to server issues, indicating that the server cannot find a more appropriate 5XX error to respond with. If you're a visitor seeing 500 errors on a web page, these issues require investigation by server owners or administrators. There are many possible causes of 500 errors, including: improper server configuration, out-of-memory (OOM) issues, unhandled exceptions, improper file permissions, or other complex factors. Server administrators may proactively log occurrences of server error responses, like the 500 status code, with details about the initiating requests to improve the stability of a service in the future.

<h1>429 (Too many requests)</h1>
<p style="width: 30%; text-align: justify;">
    A 429 response is not technically an error — it’s a response from a server, application programming interface (API), or plugin that tells the client application to stop sending requests because they simply don’t have enough resources to accept it at this time.The client application usually refers to a website or app, but can also refer to individual users like the site admin or a site visitor or hacker.
